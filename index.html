        <p>Hey there:) thanks for checking out my page, so here are a few things I'd like you to know about me,
        first my real name is Steve Marvins Gitau Wachira, I currently reside here in Jamhuri Nairobi, schooled
        primary at Elijah Kagiri then finished high school at Munoru highlands and now pursuing programming at Moringa School. </p>

        <h1>The Journey</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="jamhuri">
        <p>
          The reason as to why I wanted to learn how to code was because I've always loved playing video games since I was a kid
          and so wanted to know how to make one..bit by bit my interest evolved into passion plus upon finishing highschool
          I had a passion for Financial trading (Stock,forex and crypto trading) and since then till now I've been trading
          as a part time job and also wanted to implement trading with programming to further aid me on these trading activities.
          At the end I knew I wanted a life that would
          circumnavigate around gaming and finance(^.^)
